  Ok, this is kinda crazy. We can use the the context method on

  what files we actually want to require or import.
  Below, context will be an function/object with file names as keys.
  using that regex we are saying look in ./src/app and ./test then find
  any file that ends with spec.js and get its path. By passing in true
  we say do this recursively
